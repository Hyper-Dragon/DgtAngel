Play online with your DGT Board, mismatch detection, voice alerts (for moves and time remaining) and a 'virtual' clock.

It is designed to be be a passive addition to the play experience and does not directly interact with any web sites directly to work. Think of it as nothing more than a casual observer. An observer that will let you know if your board is out of sync with the screen and how much time you have left.
